## Introduction

Classeq is a alignment-free phylogenetic placer of sequences. Our tool perform
the placement process based on the k-mer composition of the sequences. The
placement is done using a reference tree and a set of sequences to be placed.

The placement process should be done from the command line interface (CLI) or
using the application programming interface (API) server. The CLI is the primary
way to use the tool, but the API server can be used to place sequences in a
distributed way.
